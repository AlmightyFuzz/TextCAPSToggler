# TextCAPSToggler
This is a small program that will enable the user to toggle some highlighted text between Upper and Lower case by pressing Shift+CAPS

# TODO
1. [ ] Process Text
 * Get input string
 * Set string to all Upper
 * Compare result to input, if the same then toggle to all lower (it was already in all caps)
 * Return processed string
2. [ ] Read and write from/to the Clipboard
3. [ ] Figure out how to imitate crtl+c and crtl+v to get/replace the user's highlighted text
4. [x] Implement Global HotKey
 * [ ] Fire event to trigger the process
